Excellent question. SNMPv3 is designed to silently discard packets that fail authentication, decryption, or structure validation, without sending back an error. This makes debugging harder, but here‚Äôs a full breakdown of what can go wrong and how to tell.

üõë SNMPv3 Agent: Root Causes for Silent Packet Discard
üîê Security / Auth / Priv
Cause	Description	Detection Strategy
Wrong authPassword	HMAC-SHA1 does not match msgAuthenticationParameters	Use known-good password; verify HMAC matches manually
Wrong privPassword	AES decryption fails (ScopedPDU is garbage or padding invalid)	Try decrypting on your side; look for ASN.1 format
Wrong localized key	You didn't SHA1(engineID + key + engineID) properly	Print and verify localized key (authKey/privKey)
Mismatched security level	Agent requires authPriv, but you sent authNoPriv	Check agent's config; try matching its security level
Unknown msgUserName	Agent doesn‚Äôt know this user	Check agent config, try known working user
Invalid msgAuthoritativeEngineID	Sent EngineID doesn't match what agent expects	Do discovery first, extract EngineID from agent
Wrong EngineBoots / EngineTime	Values too far from agent‚Äôs state ‚Üí potential replay	Use fresh values from discovery step
Incorrect AES IV (privParams)	IV used for AES decryption was built wrong	Print IV and check how it's built (salt + key mixing)

üì¶ Packet / Format Issues
Cause	Description	Detection
Malformed ASN.1	Agent parser can't decode packet	Validate structure with Wireshark
Too short or too long PDU	Incorrect length fields	Compare with Wireshark-captured working packet
Wrong SNMP version	Version != 3	Confirm outer header is version = 3
Invalid msgFlags	Flags don't match the PDU content	For authPriv, make sure PDU has both fields
Wrong messageID reuse	Agent thinks you're replaying a message	Increment messageID and use new salt/IV per packet

üîç How to Determine if Your Encryption Was Correct
‚úÖ Steps to Validate on Sender Side:
Check AES Decryption Matches:

After you encrypt the ScopedPDU:

c
Copy
Edit
aes_encrypt(privKey, IV, scopedPDU, ciphertext);
Try to decrypt it again locally:

c
Copy
Edit
aes_decrypt(privKey, IV, ciphertext, decrypted);
Does decrypted == scopedPDU? If not, your encryption logic or IV is wrong.

Verify msgAuthenticationParameters (HMAC):

Zero out the field in your outgoing packet.

Hash the full message:

c
Copy
Edit
hmac_sha1(authKey, message, len, digest);
Put digest in msgAuthParams (12 bytes from SHA1).

Recalculate it on your own and compare: it must match exactly.

Log and Print:

Print:

authKey (localized)

privKey (localized)

IV

msgAuthParams

ScopedPDU

Ciphertext after AES

Use Wireshark to analyze your packet:

Capture your sent packet and agent's response (or lack of)

Expand the SNMPv3 fields:

If ‚ÄúAuthentication failure‚Äù or ‚ÄúDecryption failure‚Äù is logged ‚Üí your packet is reaching the agent but being silently dropped.

üß™ Pro Debug Tip
After discovery, try sending a noAuthNoPriv packet first. It‚Äôs the simplest.

Then move up to authNoPriv to test HMAC.

Finally try authPriv.

This incremental test narrows down where the issue is.

Would you like a diagnostic helper function that validates encryption/HMAC locally?

Yes ‚Äî in SNMPv3, it is generally correct to assume that no response to a request indicates that the packet was silently discarded by the agent.

üîê Why This Happens by Design
SNMPv3 was designed with security in mind. Silently discarding invalid or suspicious packets is a deliberate defense mechanism:

Reason	Why Silent Drop?
Wrong username or passwords	Prevents user enumeration and brute-force attacks
Invalid EngineBoots/Time	Protects against replay attacks
Bad HMAC or AES	Avoids leaking info about security config
Invalid message formatting	Avoids revealing parsing logic or SNMP version
Security Level mismatch	Keeps security policies opaque

SNMPv3 never sends an error response for authentication, encryption, or security errors.

üß† So: If No Response‚Ä¶
You should assume one of these:

Packet was received but silently rejected

Packet was malformed or failed decryption/HMAC

Agent policy is blocking or filtering the request

You sent the packet to the wrong IP/port (default is UDP port 161)

There's a firewall/network issue

‚úÖ How to Confirm
Wireshark the traffic

If you see the outbound SNMPv3 request but no reply, that strongly indicates rejection.

Compare with a known-good working packet (e.g., from snmpwalk).

Agent logs (if accessible)

Some SNMP agents log auth failures internally even if they don‚Äôt reply.

Try snmpwalk with same credentials

If snmpwalk -v3 ... gets a reply but your code doesn‚Äôt, it confirms the packet is bad.

Test progressively

First try noAuthNoPriv

Then add authNoPriv (test HMAC)

Then authPriv (test AES)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important
Do not retry indefinitely if no response comes back. Always:

Set a timeout

Retry a limited number of times

Fail gracefully with a useful debug log
